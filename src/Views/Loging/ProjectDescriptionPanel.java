OBJECT ORIENTED FEATURES
============================================================

1.Extension: 
Every class inherits from ObjectPlus.
Every class has Extension for its own, so implements
public static List<Class> getClassExtent() {
    return (List<Class>) (List<?>) ObjectPlus.getExtent(Class.class);
}

2.Serialization
In ObjectPlus methods: 
ObjectPlus.writeExtents() 
ObjectPlus.readExtents()

3.Composite attribute:
Attribute Address as a private field in instances of Client Class.
Adress is composite because its Class as its own. Has different fields.

4.Optional attribute
Address is also an additional Attribute. 
Client can modify it whenever he/she wants.

5.Repeatable attribute
private final List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
Attribute that contains values that are repeatable.

6.Class attribute
public static LocalTime start = LocalTime.of(8,0); -> the opening hour of the CoffeeShop

7.Derived attribute
private float totalPrice -> is changing during preparation of the order by client.
Is dependent of clients' activities.

8.Class method
public static void manageEmployees() - class method from Boss Class it is to manage Employees. 
Implementation after clicking the button (ManageEmployeesView) shows Us the Worker who earns the most.

9.Override
Weell of course in project there are a lot of Overrides.
But the best Example is Override of the abstract method from Coffee Class.
There are 3 types of Coffee and each implements different way of counting coffeePower.
@Override
public String countPowerOfCoffee() {
    return "Power of this coffee is "+shotOfEspressoCount*presure/extractionTime;
}

10.Overload
method addProduct(Product product) is overloaded by method that takes in parameters many of Products
method addProduct(Product... product)

11.Binary Association: Client 1 -> * Orders.
Client can make a lot of orders. But every order belongs to one concrete client.
There is reverse connection. In Client we have client.addOrder(Order order) and in Order we have order.setClient(Client client)

12.Association with attribute
An Example of this association is 

13.Qualified Association
I tried but I failed

14.Composition
I tried but I failed.

15.Disjoint
Most of the inheritance are disjoint. 
For example Employees, they can not share duties with others.

16.Abstract Class:
There are two different which are abstract Person and Coffee

17.Polymorphism:
Polymorphic method is from coffee objects. CountPowerOfCoffee()

18:Multiple Inheritance:
-

19:Multi-faceted inheritance
There are two types of inheritance from Employee depends on duties (Cleaner, Waiter,Barista)
and depends on internship (LowExperienced and HighExperienced)

20.Dynamic Inheritance:
there is a possibility that Employee can become HighExperienced

21.Enumerations
There are a lot of Enums: AllPersonTypes, Citizenship, CoffeeCountry, Doneness, LanguageSkill, Level,
OrderStatus,OrderType,SatisfactionOfTheService, Sex, Shift,Size,TemperatureOfTheService,TypeOfMeal,TypeOfMilk

22 Validation Methods:
All except Boss can log in between 8 - 20
Employee can be promoted only if done at least 6 order.
